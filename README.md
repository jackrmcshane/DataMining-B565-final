## Data Mining Final Project

> This repository houses the work I did for my final project in the graduate level Data Mining class that I took at Indiana University.

> For this project I used data describing solar power generation and the weather conditions surrounding it to build multiple supervised machine learning models, with which to predict solar power generation for days in the future.
